- Implement user authentication (signup/login/logout) with JWT.
- Create CRUD operations for recipes and comments.
- Set up image upload using Cloudinary (for recipe images).
- Develop badge logic backend (basic structure).
- Test all API endpoints with Postman.
- Create Figma low-fidelity wireframes (layouts for homepage, recipe page, profile page).
- Create Figma high-fidelity designs (with color palette, fonts, UI components).

### 🎨 Week 2: Frontend Development & UI Integration
- Set up React.js frontend with routing & state management (Context API or Redux).
